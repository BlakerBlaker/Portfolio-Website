Hi, I am a Materials Scientist with extensive experience in Mechanical Engineering. 
Over the past several years I have taken on roles in metrology, reactor design, electron microscopy, and research & development.
In each of these roles I have leveraged the practical skills I acquired from my parents and grandparents with technical knowledge from my education.
In some ways I am a generalist, however whenever I am presented a challenge I devote my efforts to understanding everything I can about it.
As such I am a generalist with many specialties. This website contains a few examples of the projects that I have engaged in over the past several years.
