# Ambercycle

At Ambercycle I worke as the lead engineer to create systems and processes from the ground up. 

## Machine Shop

After we aquire a new space one of my first big projects was to design a lab space and a machine shop.

## Lab-Scale Reactors

Once the machine shoe was finished I immediately began constructing lab-scale reactors to study new processes.

Tri-Clamp parts were leveraged as often as possible to spped up the assembly process and allow for fast changes to the design.

This reactor assembly took less than a week to machine and assemble:

Jacketed Tri-Clamp parts made heating and cooling easy.
I was also able to source inexpensive VFD's and 3PH motors to create programmable stirring systems with high-torque.
